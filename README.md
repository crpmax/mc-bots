# Minecraft bot stress tester
🤖 A simple open source app written in Java used for stress testing Minecraft servers with bots (fake players).  
💥 It can be also used to test plugins or minigames.  
✔️ The MC version of the bots is 1.21.7 (supports server 1.21.8)
For older MC versions please look in the [releases](https://github.com/crpmax/mc-bots/releases " releases").

## 🆒 Features
- ✅ Connect as many bots as you want
- ✅ Use SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxies from file or URL
- ✅ Receive colored or noncolored chat
- ✅ Set connection delay
- ✅ Set messages or commands on join
- ✅ Generate random or real looking nicknames or load from file
- ✅ Online (premium) account support with login using Microsoft
- ✅ Control all or selected bots

## 📖 Usage
Minimal Java version: 17  
Use of pre-compiled jar from [releases](https://github.com/crpmax/mc-bots/releases " releases"):  
`java -jar mc-bots.jar -s <server address> [arguments]`  
When running, you can write a chat message to the terminal to send it by all bots.

## 🧪 Example
`java -jar mc-bots-1.2.17.jar -s 192.168.0.189:25565 -p BOT_ -d 4000 5000 -c 30 -r`  
This will connect 30 bots to server at 192.168.0.189:25565 with delay 4000-5000 ms and will use real-looking nicknames prefixed with BOT_
